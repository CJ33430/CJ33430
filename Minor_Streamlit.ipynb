              "       \"Safe food for a billion people. That's our mission at Ninjacart. We're working on one of the hardest supply chain problems, globally - the journey of the food we eat - from farmers all the way to the retailers who sell to us. The $168bn market in India - where nearly 96% of the market is in unorganized general trade - operates through local mandis and numerous middlemen. That's where we come in: by eliminating the middlemen and taking ownership of the entire value chain, we ensure greater value for our producers and our customers. It's a win-win for all our stakeholders: * We help farmers get better prices and deal with consistent demand - we're literally saving lives (farmer suicides are rampant in various parts of India) * We help retailers source vegetables at lower costs, ensuring freshness through highly efficient ops * We're reducing food wastage across the supply chain, saving the world in the process * Last but far from least - we're ensuring that all of us get fresher vegetables and fruits from the markets, for a better life for people in India How do we do it? We do this effectively at lower cost, better speed and larger scale using integrated supply chain powered by technology, analytics, infrastructure and logistics network. We move 600 Tonnes of produce from farmers to retailers in less than 12 hours every day! We work with 12,000+ farmers and 17,000+ retailers every month. We had been previously been operating out of Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. In the last 4 months we have launched in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, and have doubled our volumes. For our next phase of (hyper)growth, we plan to scale up to 20+ cities across India. In a short span of 3.5+ years, we have garnered support from various stakeholders who believe in our mission and stand by us. We have recently raised $100 million (Series C) which has been one of the largest investments by Tiger Global, which is the solo largest best in an Indian Startup ever by the New-York based firm. Our investors include Accel US, Syngenta Ventures, Jo Hirao, Founder of ZIGExN, Neoplux, HR Capital and Trifecta Capital, Accel India, Nandan Nilekani, Mistletoe and Qualcomm Ventures.\",\n",
